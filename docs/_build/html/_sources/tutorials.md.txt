## Example CPG system

An example file is provided with [exampleCPGSystemStudy.py](exampleCPGSystemStudy.py). This example implements a CPG system and solves for a number of reservoir depths and permeabilities. It contains a large number of scenarios and therefore runs for a long time. Hence, it should only be used as an example to derive other studies from.
